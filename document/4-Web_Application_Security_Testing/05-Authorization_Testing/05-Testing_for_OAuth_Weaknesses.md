## Summary

[OAuth2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) is an authorization delegation framework used in web-enabled applications and APIs it will be referred to as OAuth.
It enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction
between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

Authorization information is typically being proofed using an access token that if presented to a service should tell the service which access rights may be assigned to the request. Access token may be opaque tokens but very often they are JWTs, therefore the JWT checks in [Testing JSON Web Tokens](../06-Session_Management_Testing/10-Testing_JSON_Web_Tokens.md) also apply to the Testing for OAuth weaknesses chapter. The usage of Bearer Token with OAuth is described in rfc6750.

OAuth itself can be used for authentication, but it is generally not recommended implementing your own way of doing so. Instead, authentication should be implemented with the OpenID Connect standard.

Since OAuth's responsibility is it to delegate access rights across several services, successful attacks may lead to account takeover, unauthorized resource access and the elevation of privileges.

## Test Objectives

- Are the clients confidential or public
- Determine which OAuth flow is used

## How to Test

### Overview

OAuth has five different roles that are part of an OAuth exchange.

- Resource Owner, the entity who grants access to a resource
- User Agent, browser, native app
- Client, the application which requests access to a resource on behalf of the Resource Owner
- Authorization Server, a server which holds authorization information and grants the access
- Resource Server, an application that serves content accessed by the client

Based on the applications ability to keep a secret in secret it separates clients into two distinct types:

- Confidential
- Public

Confidential Clients are typically applications with server side code that are able to prevent anyone from accessing the secret.
Public Clients in contrast are unable to keep the secret in secret. An example for a Public Client would be an SPA which has all the code present on the User Agent

In order to understand the attack surface better it is crucial to determine which OAuth Grant Type is used for the application you are testing against.

These are the most common OAuth Grant Types:

- Authorization Code, commonly used with confidential client
- Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), commonly used with public clients in conjunction with Authorization Code
- Consent, Required for the approval of third party clients
- Client Credentials, used for machine to machine communication
- Device Code, used for devices with limited input capabilities

### Testing for improper Grant Type

Depending on the architecture of the application, different grant types should be used. 

The following list shows two [OAuth Grant Types](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/) that are still part of the OAuth 2.0 but are kept only to allow migration to newer Grant Types.
They are deprecated in [OAuth 2.1](https://oauth.net/2.1/) for security reasons.

- [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMtYaDmhnHU) (ROPC)) is deprecated and should only be used for migration purposes.  
- [Implicit Flow](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/) was designed to work around the lack of cross site request possibilities in browsers which is now solved with CORS.

#### How to test

For public clients it is generally possible to identify the grant type in the request to the token endpoint. It is indicated in the token exchange with the parameter `grant_type`.
The Following example shows the Authorization Code Grant + PKCE which can be identified by the `code_verifier` parameter.

```http
POST /oauth/token HTTP/2
Host: as.example.com
[...]

{
  "client_id":"example-client",
  "code_verifier":"example",
  "grant_type":"authorization_code",
  "code":"example",
  "redirect_uri":"http://client.example.com"
}
```

The different values for the grant_type parameter and which Grant Type they indicate

- grant_type `password` indicates Resource Owner Password Credential Grant
- grant_type `client_credentials` indicates the Client Credential Grant
- grant_type `authorization_code` indicates the Authorization Code Grant.

```text
Note: The implicit flow is not indicated in the grant_type since the token is  
presented in the response to the authorization request.
```

The authorization request indicates on the grant types, implicit flow and authorization code flow (with PKCE).
The following URL parameters indicate the used flow.

- `response_type=token` indicates Implicit Flow
- `response_type=code` indicates Authorization Code flow
- `code_challenge=sha256(xyz)` indicates the PKCE extension

Following is an example authorization request for Authorization Code Flow + PKCE

```http
GET /authorize
    ?redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.com%2F
    &client_id=example-client
    &scope=openid%20profile%20email
    &response_type=code
    &response_mode=query
    &state=example
    &nonce=example
    &code_challenge=example
    &code_challenge_method=S256 HTTP/2
Host: as.example.com
[...]
```

#### Public Clients

Recommended for public client is the code-grant with the PKCE extension.
An authorization request for Authorization Code Flow + PKCE should contain `response_type=code` and `code_challenge=sha256(xyz)`.

Further the token exchange should contain the grant type `authorization_code` and a `code_verifier`.

Improper grant types for public client:

- Code Grant without the PKCE extension
- Client Credentials
- Implicit flow
- Resource Owner Password Credential Grant

#### Confidential Clients

The code-grant is recommended for confidential client and the PKCE extension may be used as well.

Improper grant types for confidential client:

- Resource Owner Password Credential Grant
- Implicit flow
- Client Credentials (Except for Machine to Machine)

##### Machine to Machine

Machine to Machine clients generally should be able to keep a secret and therefore may be confidential clients. No user interaction can happen and they may rely solely on the client secret with the Client Credentials grant.

If you already know the client id and secret it is possible to obtain a token with the `client_credentials` grant type.

```bash
Î» curl --request POST \
  --url https://as.example.com/oauth/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"client_id":"example-client","client_secret":"THE_CLIENT_SECRET","audience":"https://as.example.com/","grant_type":"client_credentials"}' --proxy http://localhost:8080/ -k
```

### Credential Leakage via Referrer Header

OAuth transports, dependent on the flow, several types of credentials in the URL.
The following tokens can be considered as credentials.

- access token
- refresh token
- authorization code
- PKCE code challenge / code verifier

Due to how OAuth works, the authorization `code` as well as the `code_challenge` and `code_verifier` may be part of the URL.
Therefore, it is even more relevant to ensure those are not sent in the Referer Header.

The implicit grant transports the authorization token as part of the URL which may lead to leakage of the authorization token in the referrer and other places like log files and proxies.

#### How to test

Make use of an HTTP Interception proxy such as OWASP ZAP and intercept the OAuth traffic.

- Step through the authorization process and identify any credentials being present in the URL.
- If any external resources are included in a page involved with the OAuth flow analyze request made to them as
  credentials could be leaked in the referrer header.

After stepping through the oAuth flow and using the application for a while few requests are captured in the request history of an HTTP interception proxy. Search for the Referer Header (`Referer: https://idp.example.com/`) containing the IdP and Client URL in the request history.

## Remediation

- When implementing OAuth always consider the used technology whether it is a server side application that can keep a secret or a client side application which can't.
- In almost any case use the Authorization Code Flow + PKCE. Exceptions to that are machine to machine flows.
- Use Post parameters or Header values to transport secrets.
- When no other possibility exists, legacy applications that can not be migrated for example, implement additional
  security headers like a `Referrer-Policy` policy.
